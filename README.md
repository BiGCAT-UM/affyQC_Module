affyQC_Module
=============

Affymetrix microarrays of different technology versions are very often used in transcriptomics analysis.  Quality control and normalization approaches do exist, especially as packages in Bioconductor/R. However: -	Procedures are often different between teams. -	They are not always easy to access as they run through command lines. -	It is often not clear what the meaning of the specific settings and results are -	They are not always usable for the newer technology types of arrays. To tackle this, we proposed an automated well-documented and user-friendly pipeline for Affymetrix microarray quality control and normalization.
